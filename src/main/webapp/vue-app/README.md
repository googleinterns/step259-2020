# vue-app

A simple rewrite of the basic functionality of the client, using Vue.js for all frontend code.
Some features are most likely missing. The main goal is to set up and use a usable environment
for working with modern frontend apps.

## SPA

The result is a [Single Page App](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application).

The main difference between a SPA and a regular, oldschool app, is that there is only one html file
serving all subpages. It's content is dynamically rendered based on some magic JS code, usually provided
by a framework (here: Vue.js).

## Development

*Important*
To run any of the tools described below, you need to install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) on your machine.

From a developer's perspective, one of the key differences between the old approach (including js files in a
HTML file, which populate the global namespace) and the modern approach used in this directory, is the introduction
of a build step - the files we write are not the same files that are seen by the browser.

A browser is able to render HTML files, which may define script dependencies as `<script>` tags. If we
defined every small piece of logic in a separate file, we'd have to include hundreds `script` tags in the final HTML.

What we can do instead is work on small modules during development, and then have a script bundle them together into
a single js file sent to the browser.
[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) is the most popular such tool.

There's many other fancy things we can do with our JS files, including:

- testing - https://jestjs.io/
- transpiling from TypeScript - https://www.typescriptlang.org/
- linting (statically checking for errors in code) - https://eslint.org/
  ... and many, many more.

## Vue-CLI

Not going into details, managing all those tools also gets unwieldy. Luckily, there's tools bundling those tools.
One such tool, tailored for working with Vue.js is [Vue-CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/).

## meal-assistant-client
All client source code is stored under meal-assistant-client.
A large portion of the code has been generated by running `vue create meal-assistant-client`.
vue-cli produces a comprehensible README file. See meal-assistant-client/README.md for details how to use
the app.

### TLDR
```
cd meal-assistant-client
npm run install  # install all dependencies. They'll be installed to node_modules/.
npm run serve  # compile the bundle and start a local server. The app will be accessible at localhost:8080
```
